            <p>First, heat the water. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, so
            the water maintains a gentle boil.</p> 
            
            <p>Then, add the eggs. Using a slotted spoon, carefully lower the eggs into
                the simmering water. Use a timer.</p> 
            
            <p>While the eggs cook, prepare the ice bath. Fill a large bowl
                with cold water, and add a handful of ice.</p>
            
            <p>When the timer goes off, remove the eggs from the hot water, and
                immediately add them to the ice bath. Allow them to chill for at least 3 minutes.</p> 
            
            <p>Finally, peel the eggs!
                Tap the bottom of a soft boiled egg to remove a little of the shell. Carefully slide a small spoon between
                the egg and its shell, and slide it around the egg to loosen the shell and remove it. I love this easy
                method for peeling a soft boiled egg, but it can take a little practice to get just right. If you prefer,
                you can also peel the eggs with your hands, like I do in my hard boiled egg recipe.</p>

            <p>Repeat the peeling process with the remaining eggs, and enjoy!</p>
